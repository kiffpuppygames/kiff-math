# kiff-math

A Linear Algebra Library with 64bit precision as its primary focus based on zmath (https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zig-gamedev/tree/main/libs/kmath). 

I want a linear algebra library that runs on zig latest and can be easily used on its own without having functionality you don't use or having to copy and paste folders around.

# Status
The library currently has base support for quaternions and 3d vectors.
